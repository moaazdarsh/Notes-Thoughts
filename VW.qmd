## Circular Motion:
using polar coordinates is simpler for circular motion
so the following are some important kinematic definitions in polar coordinates and periodic motion.

**Angular Displacement**   $\bar\theta = \bar\theta_f - \bar\theta_i$, measured in $rad$.

**Angular Velocity**   $\bar\omega = \frac{d\bar\theta}{dt}$, measured in $rad/s$.

**Angular Acceleration**   $\bar\alpha = \frac{d\bar\omega}{dt}$, measured in $rad/s^2$.

**Frequency** $(f) = \frac{no. \: of \: turns}{\Delta t}$

**Periodic time** $(T) = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}= \frac{1}f$

## Forced Occillations:
a spring system that is affected by an external force $F = F_0 cos(\Omega t)$ and a damping force $F_D = -rv$ will be described by the following equation of motion.

$$
m\ddot{x}  + k_s x + r\dot{x} = F_0cos(\Omega t)
$$

solving this differential equation we get

$x = Acos(\Omega t - \phi)$, 
where $A(\Omega) = \frac{F_0}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \Omega^2)^2 + (2\alpha \Omega)^2}}$ and $\phi = tan^{-1}( \frac{2\alpha \Omega}{\omega_0^2 - \Omega^2})$.

the frequency of applied force that will result in the greatest amplitude is $\Omega_A = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 -2\alpha^2}$
and that maximum amplitude is $A = \frac{F_0}{r \sqrt{\omega_0^2 -\alpha^2}}$.

if we want the spring to oscillate at maximum velocity however, then $\Omega = \omega_0$, the amplitude $A = \frac{F_0}{r\omega_0}$, and $v_{max} = \frac{F_0}r$.

## Waves:
Waves can be classified based on three criteria, firstly:

**Mechanical Waves:** need a medium to propagate.

**Electromagnetic Waves:** doesn't need a medium.

secondly:

**Transverse:** the vibration is perpendicular to wave propagation.

**Longitudinal:** the vibration is parallel to wave propagation.

and lastly, **Travelling and Standing Waves**.

#### Wave equation
The function of a wave moving in a line is $y = f(kx-\omega t)$, from this we can find the differential equation for wave motion.

$$
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} 
$$

However, we're only concerned with sinusoidal waves which behave according to this equation.

$$
y(x,t) = Acos(kx-\omega t) = Acos(x-vt)
$$

where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}T$ and $k = \frac{2\pi}\lambda$
